        <h3>Programmer Intern at Libra Internet Bank</h3>
        <p>I applied my knowledge and enthusiasm to real-world applications by working in industry as a programming intern at Libra Internet Bank, where I have learned the programming language jBASE, how to work with Temenos and how to create routines for T24.

I participated in many projects that included creating menus in the program T24 for the people in branches and I also helped at solving and preventing software problems. Joining a company as an intern gave me the opportunity to work hands on in a professional environment, to attend meetings and events, interact with professionals that helped me make new connections and learn how to communicate in a professional environment. I became a master of time management and I had the opportunity to improve my development skills working on projects with other programmers and to cooperate with them.</p>
