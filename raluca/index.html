						<h1 class = "hsContainer" >Milan, Italy</h1>
						<img  src="milan1.jpg" class = "imgpoze" alt="poza MILAN">
						<p>		History lovers should know that Milan is not all about trendy shops and designer clothes. Among the city's many historical attractions are La Scala Opera, the Milan Cathedral, the National Museum of Science and Technology and Santa Maria della Grazie, the church that preserves da Vinci's "Last Supper".</p>
						<p>		The Duomo is a large gothic cathedral wrapped in history, art and architecture. Style is a bit over the top and clumsy, as compared to some of the greats like Chartres new Paris. Yet it has a majesty of it's own.To really appreciate the intricacies and details, you must go to the terraces. The details of the spires is impressive and helps you appreciate the impact of them. The gift shop felt too commercial and had less spiritual gifts, which I expected from prior visits to global cathedrals. Definitely worth the visit.</p>
						<img  src="duomo.jpg" class = "imgpoze" alt="poza DUOMO">
						<p>		Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is a wonderful place and one of Milano Highlights,near to the Duomo Cathedral, it si in the heart of the city and offers a unique possibility of a nice walk in the old center among beautiful boutiques and lovely coffe shops.</p>
						<img  src="galerie.jpg" class = "imgpoze" alt="poza Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II">
						<p>		From the outside this opera house looks very bland although just a few metres from the very grand Cathedral but once inside you see the luxury, colour and brilliant architecture of this beautiful building. We took the guided tour which at Euro25 is not value for money BUT it is the only option if you cant afford the Euro3000 for a seat at the opera and no idea how much for one of the many red boxes that surround the stage!. I would have liked to have piped opera music during the tour to get an idea of the atmosphere. The red & gold of the boxes and chairs, the amazing Royal box, the marble walls of the walkways that lead you to the boxes and then the WOW back stage which is like a huge factory with a very busy back stage staff getting sets ready, it is like a bee hive of activity!!. The building was closed for several years from 2003?? for a major makeover to the back stage area to allow a major improvement in how stage sets are built and replaced for different shows, actually very impressed. Overall, if you are in Milan then it is an impressive place to visit and great if you can afford a ticket, one of our group was attending an orchestra based show that evening which is significantly cheaper and you can still enjoy the atmosphere and history</p>

						<h1 class = "hsContainer" >Larnaca, Cyprus</h1>
						<img  src="larnaca.jpg" class = "imgpoze" alt="poza LARNACA">
						<p>		Larnaca is a city on the southern coast of Cyprus and the capital of the eponymous district. It is the third-largest city in the country, after Nicosia and Limassol, with a metro population of 144,200.Larnaca is known for its palm-tree seafront, the Church of Saint Lazarus, the Hala Sultan Tekke, the Kamares Aqueduct and its medieval fort. It is built on the ruins of ancient Citium, which was the birthplace of Stoic philosopher Zeno.</p>
						<p>		You can not visit Larnaca without having at least a Little glimps of this little beautiful Church (Saint Lazarus Church). Even if you normally don´t visit churches, see it as an objekt of intrest. You don,t have to go there when the have services. It´s a histoorical landmark wort seein for its own sake, like the old fort lokated a bit further down the street, towards the sea. It´s one of the "Must see" places in Larnaca.</p>

						<p>		Dived the Zenobia Wreck with Cyprus Diving Adventures who were fab! The Zenobia was our first wreck dive and it will definitely not be our last. Visibility is amazing (about 25-30m) and the wreck is really quite breathtaking! Zenobia is an absolute must if you’re a diver!!</p>

						<p>	If you are staying around the Finikoudes beach, the Larnaka Medieval Castle is a place which you can't skip, as it is located at the end of the Finikoudes promenade. Lots of history has passed through the entrance to these walls . If you stand back and look you see it has been touched by islam ,christians , the british colonialism , German artillery from the early twentieth century . There are some interesting artefacts in the museum. There are also great views from the top if the castle walls.</p>
